Query:
select h1.name,h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade, h3.name, h3.grade
from Likes l1 join Likes l2
on l1.ID2 = l2.ID1 and l1.ID1 <> l2.ID2
join Highschooler h1 on h1.ID = l1.ID1
join Highschooler h2 on h2.ID = l2.ID1
join Highschooler h3 on h3.ID = l2.ID2

Q2) Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades.
Query:
select name, grade from Highschooler h 
where ID not in 
(select ID1 from Friend f1,Highschooler h2 where f1.ID1 = h.ID and f1.ID2 = h2.ID
and h.grade = h2.grade)

Q3) What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.) 
Query:
select avg(cnt) from
(select count(ID2) as cnt from Friend group by ID1)

Q4) Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend
Query:
select count(distinct ID2) from Friend f where ID1 in (select ID from Highschooler where name='Cassandra' union
select ID2 from Friend where ID1 = (select ID from Highschooler where name='Cassandra')) 
and ID2 not in (select ID from Highschooler where name='Cassandra')

Q5) Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends.
Query:
select name , grade from Highschooler
where ID in 
(select ID1 from Friend group by ID1 having 
count(ID2) =  (select max(cnt) from (select count(ID2) cnt from Friend f2 group by ID1)))
